        <strong>A description of my journey:</strong><br>
        I started developing a passion for technology when I was 12 years old.
        At 13, I discovered the world of economics and finance, which led me to study financial markets,
        from microeconomics and business operations to macroeconomics and national economies. 
        Over time, I expanded my interests into artificial intelligence, 
        developing AI models using PyTorch and experimenting with deep learning architectures to understand how 
        intelligent systems function. <br>
        Beyond software and AI, I have also explored hardware and engineering. 
        I learned car mechanics on my own, understanding how engines, transmissions, and vehicle systems work. 
        I have worked with TI logic gates and digital circuit design, gaining insight into how fundamental hardware 
        components process information. <br>
        Currently, I’m working on multiple projects, including SQL database management, Java application development, 
        front-end web development and network infrastructure design.. 
        I believe in deep thinking, exploration, and persistence. 
        My goal is to master computing, AI, engineering, and finance, create innovative solutions, 
        and contribute to a more efficient and sustainable future.
    </p>
    
    <p class="bottom-text">In the future, I hope to do something important.</p>
